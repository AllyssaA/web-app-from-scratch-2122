# Common issues revolving WAFS

## Code attribution/ plagiarism
- You're allowed to use code you found online (unless its license mentions otherwise)
- You should always credit the creator and source of used code
- For important pieces of code, include them in the acknowledgements at the bottom of your readme.
- For ALL code you haven't written, include the source in a comment right above the line where you use the code.
- If you base a project off of someone else's project, mention it explicitly in the code at the top of your file as well as in the readme.
