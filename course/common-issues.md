# Common issues revolving WAFS

## Code attribution/ plagiarism
- You're allowed to use code you found online (unless its license mentions otherwise)
- You should always credit the creator and source of used code
- For important pieces of code, include them in the acknowledgements at the bottom of your readme.
- For ALL code you haven't written, include the source in a comment right above the line where you use the code.
- If you base a project off of someone else's project, mention it explicitly in the code at the top of your file as well as in the readme.

## OOP versus functional approach
- You're allowed to commit to either strategy.
- [Here's a nice example of an OOP web app](https://github.com/TimTerwijn/web-app-from-scratch-1920). Notice how object are responsible and self contained. Also notice how you need to jump through the code a lot in order to follow the flow of control.
- [Tomas](https://github.com/TomasS666/web-app-from-scratch-1920/tree/master/docs) went for a more functional approach. Here it's easier to chain functionalities together and the code reads more like human language.
