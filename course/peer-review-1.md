- Get feedback on your work

## Preparation
- Push the latest changes to your readme, code, and wiki
- [Read the rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTC69BUOGNQj_bLQE9LiprKGYChzb4LOoROoUiLUP8DReOcFLqS5k90Wu1LK9L5r1IVq7BDA1qISp5u/pubhtml). Is everything clear?
- Find your buddy

## First Review

### Repository
- Scan your buddy's repository
    + Repo description (at the top)
    + gitignore
    + concept
    + API description

### Code
- Read the code
    + Try to understand the code flow
    + Check the code against our course's [best practices](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/best-practices/blob/master/web-app-from-scratch.md)
    + Check the code for consistency, is code being written the same way in different places?
    + Does the code follow naming conventions? Do variable and function names make sense to you?
- Assess assignment according to rubric (If you cant assess something, write in an issue why)https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTC69BUOGNQj_bLQE9LiprKGYChzb4LOoROoUiLUP8DReOcFLqS5k90Wu1LK9L5r1IVq7BDA1qISp5u/pubhtml
- Write your feedback in issues on their repo (separate issue for each thing)
- Positive feedback is also welcome and can be put into an issue

## Second Review


## Closure
- Review the issues that were created for your own repo. Ask your peer about them if you don't understand.
- Respond to the issues with an action (for instance: valid point, will fix)
- Close relevant issues before the assessment by solving them.
