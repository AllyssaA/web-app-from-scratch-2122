# Week 1: â€˜Hello Worldâ€™

Minor Web Development - Web App From Scratch

## Intention

The coming weeks you will create a client side web app during this course. 
Based upon data from the API of your chosen user story, you design, build and test a prototype in three iterations. 
You write vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaSCript, and avoid to use frameworks or libraries as much as possible - with the exception of a micro library if neccessary. 

### Goals this week: â€˜Hello Worldâ€™ 

Kennismaken met de minor en met elkaar.

### Next week: â€˜Design & refactorâ€™ ðŸ› 

Pick an user story. Design the interface. Retrieve data from the chosen API and build the interface. [Check it out](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/web-app-from-scratch-2122/blob/main/course/week-2.md)
