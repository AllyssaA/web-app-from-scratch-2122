# Week 1: ‚ÄòHello API‚Äô üêí

Minor Web Development - Web App From Scratch

## Goal 

Pick a user story, sketch the interface, retrieve data from an API and build the interface.

## Intention

The coming three weeks you will create a client side web app during this course. Based upon data from the API of your chosen user story, you design, build and test a prototype in three iterations. You write as much vanilla code as possible, and avoid to use frameworks or libraries as much as possible - with the exception of a micro library if neccessary. 

### This week: ‚ÄòHello API‚Äô üêí

Pick an user story. Design the interface. Retrieve data from the chosen API and render structured content in the interface.

### Next week: ‚ÄòDesign & refactor‚Äô üõ†

Iterate on the user story. Add routes and states. Refactor code into modules.

## Exercises

1. Fork GitHub repository for this course and setup the README.md 
2. Pick a user story and design the interface
3. Loading asynchronous data from the API and render structured content in the interface
4. Conduct Code Review via GitHub  


### 1. Fork GitHub repository for this course and setup the README.md 

All code and documentation that you write (for all courses and projects in this minor) will be in a GitHub repository. Make a neat layout of files and folders. Make sure that the code can also be viewed via GitHub Pages as rendered HTML, CSS & JavaScript. A Github repo is only complete if it contains a description and readme (with a poster image of the project). We have already prepared a repository that you can fork.

Fork this repository: https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/web-app-from-scratch-2021

Open issues on your repo so that you can get feedback!
Publish your web app with Github pages and add the link to the web app in the repo description.

A good app comes with a good README.md in which you describe the application. Add the chapters below and document your app.

* linkToLiveDemo? review (assignment): assignGrade (1);  
* What does your app do, what is the goal? (passing butter)  
* Which actors are there in your application? (actor diagram)  
* Which API is used and what are the limitations? (rate limit)  
* How does flowed interaction through the application? (interaction diagram)  
* Which design patterns and best practices  
* What would you like to add (feature wishlist / backlog)  

*(Also see the commented hints in the README.md)*

### 2. Pick a user story and design the interface

Pick User Story.. 
Sketch user flow in wireflow..

### 3. Loading asynchronous data from the API and build interface

Requesting data from an API can take a relatively long time that your program would not have to wait for.   
That is why you are going to make an asynchronous request to the API.

#### Fetch data from your API

Create a request object in your code with which you load data (a list of items) with an asynchronous call from the chosen API.  
Parse the JSON into a JavaScript object.

#### Build the interface

Breakdown sketch: break the wireflow down in HTML, CSS.   
Render the data object into structured HTML and style the interface with CSS.

### 4. Conduct code review: add issues on GitHub (vrijdag)

On GitHub you can use Issues to suggest changes to a colleague developer's code. You can do this online via the GitHub website.
Create at least 2 issues for different peer students. You can look at improvements / suggestions for or questions about HTML, CSS & JavaScript code.
