# Web App From Scratch @cmda-minor-web 2021 - 2022

In this course you will learn to build a web application without frameworks or unnecessary libraries, but with vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript as much as possible. The end result is a modular, single page web app (SPA). Data will be retrieved from an external API, manipulated and finally shown in the UI of the App. You will learn to apply interface principles when building and testing the interface. With the gained knowledge you will be able to build interactive prototypes, based on real data. Also you will gain a better understanding of how API's, frameworks and libraries work.

## Assignment

Design and build a single page web app based on a user story.

## Program

### Week 1 - Hello API üêí

Goal: Pick a user story, design the interface, retrieve data from an API and render the structured content.

[Instructions](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/web-app-from-scratch-2122/blob/master/course/week-1.md)

### Week 2 - Design and Refactor üõ†

Goal: Iterate and improve UI. Add routes and states. refactor code into modules.

### Week 3 - Wrapping up üéÅ

Goal: Iterate and improve UI. Manipulate data. Feedback to the user.

## Best Practices
All work during this course will be tested against our [Best Practices for JavaScript](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/best-practices/blob/master/javascript.md).

## Rubric
Your efforts will be graded using a single point rubric (see below). You will have to pass the criterion (centre column) to pass the course. During the test you will be consulted and will be given feedback on things we think deficient and things we think are an improvement on the criterion.

| Deficiency | Criterion | Improvement |
|:--|:--|:--|
|  | *Design Patterns* you build and test the user interface by applying interface design principles |  |
|  | *Code structure* you write modular, consistent and efficient HTML, CSS and JavaScript code by applying structure and best practices. You manage state for the application and the UI |  |
|  | *Data management* you understand how you can work with an external API using asynchronous code. You can retrieve data, manipulate and dynamically convert it to structured html |  |
|  | *Project* your app is working and published on GitHub Pages. Your project is thoroughly documented in the `README.md` file in your repository.  |  |

<!-- Add a link to your live demo in Github Pages üåê-->

<!-- ‚òùÔ∏è replace this description with a description of your own work -->

<!-- replace the code in the /docs folder with your own, so you can showcase your work with GitHub Pages üåç -->

<!-- Add a nice poster image here at the end of the week, showing off your shiny frontend üì∏ -->

<!-- Maybe a table of contents here? üìö -->

<!-- How about a section that describes how to install this project? ü§ì -->

<!-- ...but how does one use this project? What are its features ü§î -->

<!-- What external data source is featured in your project and what are its properties üå† -->

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ‚úÖ -->

<!-- How about a license here? üìú (or is it a licence?) ü§∑ -->
